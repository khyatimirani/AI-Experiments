# AI-Experiments

AI-Experiments is a hands-on learning playground where I explore, build, break, and deeply understand modern artificial intelligence systems.

This repository is a collection of practical experiments across the AI stack—ranging from large language models (LLMs) and tokenization, to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agent workflows, embeddings, and multimodal AI. Each experiment is intentionally small, focused, and exploratory, designed to uncover how things actually work beyond abstractions and frameworks.

Rather than aiming for polished products, this repo emphasizes:

learning by implementation

questioning assumptions

comparing approaches across models and providers

understanding trade-offs in cost, tokens, performance, and design

As my understanding of AI evolves, so does this repository. Think of it as a living lab—documenting experiments, failures, insights, and incremental progress while navigating the rapidly changing AI landscape.

What you’ll find here

🔬 Tokenization & cost experiments (character, subword, model-level)

🧠 LLM explorations across providers and model families

📚 RAG pipelines and retrieval strategies

🤖 Agent workflows and orchestration patterns

🧩 Embeddings & semantic search

🖼️ Multimodal experiments (text, audio, images where applicable)

📝 Notes & learnings distilled from hands-on work

Philosophy

Learn AI not just by reading papers or using APIs—but by building, measuring, and breaking things until the mental models are clear.
